Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the analysis

This challenge involved building and evaluating select machine learning models to predict credit risk.

Results

One way of validating a model's performance is by its accuracy score. The following is a list of three models for predicting credit risk and their associated accuracy scores:

Summary 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
