Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the analysis

This challenge involved building and evaluating select machine learning models to predict credit risk.

Results

One way of validating a model's performance is by its accuracy score. The following is a list of three models for predicting credit risk and their associated accuracy scores:

  Resampling model accuracy score:

  Ensemble Classifiers accuracy score:
  
  
  
  



Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.


Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
